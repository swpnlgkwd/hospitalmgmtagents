Date interpretation rules:
- When the user provides a date without a year, always assume the year is the current one ({{currentYear}}). If the date has already passed this year, then assume the next occurrence in the following year.
- When a user provides a date without a year, assume the **current calendar year**.
- If the given date has already passed this year and no explicit intent is clear, **ask the user if they meant the next occurrence** (e.g., next year).
- Always interpret date expressions like "next Monday", "this weekend", or "after Diwali" with respect to the current date in the **Indian Standard Time** zone.
